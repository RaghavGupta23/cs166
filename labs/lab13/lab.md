Lab 13: Attack a Simple Protocol
==============================

Review the protocol at http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~austin/cs166-spring17/labs/Protocol.pdf (Links to an external site.).  Determine 2 attacks against this protocol.

Submit your attacks and a modified version of the protocol that will avoid this attack.

For bonus fun, trade protocols with another group and try to break their revised protocol.
