Think like an attacker. Break into a website!

Form groups of 2 or 3 students.  Go to http://cs31.cs.sjsu.edu/ and click on "basic login example".  Your job is to break in to this site.  Review some common passwords from http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/25-most-used-passwords-revealed-is-yours-one-of-them/12427.

Find a username and password and use it to log in to the website.  (Note that many of the usernames are based on the names of superheroes).

What username did you discover?  What is the password for that username?  Submit as many usernames and passwords as you are able to guess.  (If you do not have a Canvas account, email me at thomas.austin@sjsu.edu).
