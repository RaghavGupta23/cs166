> hash function that produces values n bits long, how to brute force this, and expected work factor

A collision is guaranteed after hashing all possible sequences n bits long, although due to the birthday problem, a collision is expected in half the "keyspace", or n/2. Since these are bits, the expected hashes necessary is thus 2^(n/2)

## 4

> Expected # of collisions in the following cases

a. hash function with 12 bit output, and hashes of 1024 random messages
1024 = 2^10
Since 2^10 is well over half the keyspace, at least one or two collisions are expected.

b. hash function with n bit output, and hashes of m random messages
